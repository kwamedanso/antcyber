# Advanced Fullstack Starter Template

A robust, production-ready starter template built with **React (Vite)**, **Node.js (Express)**, and **PostgreSQL**.

This template comes fully configured out of the box with a secure JWT authentication flow (using both access and HTTP-only refresh tokens), protected routing, and efficient data caching.

---

## 🚀 Features

### Frontend (React + Vite)

- **Vite** for blazing fast HMR and optimized builds.
- **React Router DOM** pre-configured with public, private routes, and layout wrappers.
- **Tanstack Query (React Query)** pre-configured for data fetching, caching, and state management.
- **Axios Interceptors** setup for automatically attaching credentials to API requests.
- **Solid Auth Flow**: Ready-to-go `Login`, `Register`, `Dashboard` and `Users` pages with context providers managing the auth state.

### Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL)

- **Express.js** API with pre-configured CORS, Cookie-Parser, and JSON body parsing.
- **PostgreSQL Database** integration (`pg` module) with structured schemas for Users and Refresh Tokens.
- **Secure Authentication**:
  - Passwords hashed via `bcryptjs`.
  - Dual token system (`jsonwebtoken`): short-lived access tokens and long-lived HTTP-only, secure refresh cookies.
- **Form validation workflows** pre-written for login and registration handlers.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or newer recommended)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

---

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Ensure PostgreSQL is running on your machine.

1. Connect to PostgreSQL and create a database (e.g., `starter`).
2. Run the SQL schema script provided in `backend/config/databaseSchema.sql` to initialize your `users` and `refresh_tokens` tables.

### 2. Backend Initialization

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create your environment variables:
   Copy `.env.example` to a new `.env` file and fill in your database credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   _Note: Update the DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, DB_PORT based on your Postgres configuration._
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5177` (or your defined `PORT`).

### 3. Frontend Initialization

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will launch and typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
   _(Note: Vite is pre-configured to automatically proxy `/api` requests directly to your backend, avoiding pesky CORS issues during development!)_

## 📖 Frontend Developer API Reference

This template is built on a highly modular, decoupled architecture. Below is a guide to the core hooks and components you will use to build out the frontend.

### 🌐 API Context & Tokens
- **`axios.js`**: Defines the Axios instances. Contains the standard `axios` for public requests (like login/register), and an `axiosPrivate` instance built specifically with `withCredentials: true` to ensure HTTP-Only refresh cookies are sent to the backend.
- **`useAxiosPrivate.js`**: This is the engine of the Auth flow. It acts as an interceptor hook. It automatically attaches the active `accessToken` to all outbound requests. If a request responds with `401 Unauthorized`, it automatically queues the failed requests, triggers a silent token refresh, and seamlessly retries the requests.
- **`useRefreshToken.js`**: Hits the `/api/auth/refresh` backend endpoint to use the HTTP-Only cookie to retrieve a new short-lived access token, updating the global context automatically.
- **`usePrivateQuery.js`**: A custom wrapper around Tanstack's `useQuery`. It natively integrates `useAxiosPrivate` inside the query so that your server data fetching mechanisms natively support automatic token rotation and caching.

### 🔐 Auth Context & Initialization
- **`AuthProvider.jsx`**: The React Context Provider that wraps the entire application tree, storing the globally accessible session state (e.g., `accessToken` and the `user` object payload).
- **`useAuth.js`**: A lightweight hook that consumes the `AuthProvider`, allowing any component to easily grab the user's role or access token via `const { auth, setAuth } = useAuth();`.
- **`AuthInitializer.jsx`**: Wrapped just outside the Router. the moment a user hard-refreshes the page, this component fires first. It attempts a silent `useRefreshToken()` call to check if a valid session cookie exists and silently restores the `auth` state, preventing a "flash of unauthenticated content" before rendering the app.

### 🛣️ Routing & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The `createBrowserRouter` configuration inside **`App.jsx`** organizes security logically by utilizing Layout Wrappers:

- **`ProtectedRoutes.jsx`**: A React Router `<Outlet />` wrapper. It checks if `auth?.accessToken` exists. If the user isn't logged in, they are forcibly redirected to `/login`, while preserving their originally intended destination in strict state.
- **`Authorize.jsx`**: The role-based restriction wrapper. It takes an array prop (`allowedRoles={[...]} `). It checks `auth.user.role` against the array. If the user is logged in but doesn't map to an authorized role, it redirects them out of the unauthorized area.

*Example usage in `App.jsx`:*
```jsx
{
  element: <ProtectedRoutes />, // Blocks unauthenticated users
  children: [
    {
      element: <Authorize allowedRoles={["administrator"]} />, // Blocks non-admins
      children: [
        { path: "users/create", element: <CreateUser /> },
      ],
    }
  ],
}
```

- **`DashboardLayout.jsx`**: A role-aware UI Layout component. It dynamically reads your context and filters rendering elements based on roles. For example, the Sidebar configuration automatically filters out navigation links that the logged-in user isn't authorized to visit:
```jsx
const navItems = [
  { path: "/admin/dashboard", label: "Dashboard", roles: ["administrator", "staff"] },
  { path: "/admin/users", label: "Users", roles: ["administrator"] },
];
// Automatically filters out the "Users" button if a "staff" member logs in
```

## Next Steps

- Consider replacing the manually written validation utilities with a library like **Zod** or **Express-Validator** for robust edge-case handling.
- Build upon the `database.js` connection pool to include an ORM (like Prisma or Drizzle) or a query builder.
